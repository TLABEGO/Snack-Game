# Calculator-App

This is the old classic snack Gamne bulit purely in core Java using Eclipse IDE. 

It is not the best snack game available but it is by far my best project. I learned so much in the process of creating the game
mostly about the the Swing Framwork for user interfaces and implementing bulid in functions, like the graphices methods. Perfection 
is overrated!!!.. I know, i know, i know there might be few bugs here and there but i am a human too, i am not perfect so i always 
leave a room for improvement, with that said you're welcome to point out bugs so i can fixs them.

By the way, i love feedbacks!!
